# VR Knife Stabbing Simulation Project

## Project Description

This project aims to create a virtual reality (VR) experience simulating the sensation of being stabbed in the stomach with a knife. The simulation uses a TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) massager machine to emulate the pain sensation. An Arduino is used to control the modes of the TENS massager, providing a more realistic simulation of pain. The Arduino is connected to Unity through C# code, without the need for additional plugins, allowing seamless integration between the hardware and software components.

### Key Features:
- **VR Simulation**: Immersive virtual reality experience that visually and physically simulates a knife stabbing.
- **Pain Simulation**: Utilizes a TENS massager machine to create a realistic sensation of pain.
- **Arduino Control**: Arduino microcontroller used to change modes of the TENS massager based on the simulation.
- **Unity Integration**: Arduino seamlessly connected to Unity via C# code without requiring plugins.
